# Insurance
An analysis of factors which determine the cost of insurance for an individual.

The data looks at six variables which determine the cost of insurance for individuals: Age, Sex, BMI, Children, Smoker and Region. These variables are explored in their relationship with the dependent variable and their collinearity with one another. Ideal demographics for charging insurance premiums or offering insurance discounts are also investigated.

The data is modelled afterwards using Linear Regression. The effects of scaling and regularization upon the data is also explored. The final model yields an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.734.
